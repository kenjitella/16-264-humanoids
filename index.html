    <p>for homework 1 I created a python program that uses the webcam in the computer to determine the distance between you and the computer the user
        inputs the distance between their eyes and the program will use that to determine the distance between the user and the computer.

    <p>I used opencv to find the pixel locations of both of the eyes. Using the pinhole camera model which is a reasonably good aproximation of a real camera it is possible to determine the 
        distance between the user and the computer. The pinhole camera model is a simple model that assumes that light travels in straight lines and that the camera is a single point.
